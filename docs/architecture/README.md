## Best Practices
- **Microservices Architecture**: Design the system using microservices to ensure scalability and separation of concerns.
- **Service Discovery**: Implement service discovery mechanisms to allow microservices to find each other dynamically.
- **API Gateway**: Use an API gateway to manage routing, load balancing, and security for microservices.
