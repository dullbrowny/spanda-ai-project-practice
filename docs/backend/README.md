# Backend Guide

This folder contains the backend documentation for the project.

## Best Practices
- **Clean Code**: Write clean, modular, and well-documented code to improve readability, maintainability, and debugging.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage unexpected issues and failures.
- **Scalability**: Design the backend to scale horizontally or vertically as needed to handle increased load.
